= wktime
This Plugin provides the capability to submit weekly timesheets within redmine. The user must be a 
member of a project with permission to log time.  If the user has permission to manage other team
members, he can manage their timesheets as well.

This plugin uses the Time Entry model and presents them in a weekly view.
New Timesheets can be entered using the link ‘New wk-time’, new issues can be added to the 
timesheet using the ‘Add Row’ link.

If duplicate entries are made on a new timesheet, it will sum up the hours for those duplicate entries.

Just unpack the zip file to the plugins folder of Redmine, it should start working fine.
This plugin uses js and css assets and it will be copied to public/plugin_asset/redmine_wktime
folder upon server startup, so please make sure public/plugin_asset/redmine_wktime has proper access.
